Ideas:
- Add per member set flag. Will be enable by default, except for list of known attributes.

Short term:
- Reset all stream sub commands to default when adding stream?
- Reset all port sub-commands when reseting port? 
- Add from/to to stop_capture. See if IxeCaptureBuffer can be refactored so it does not have special ix_ methods.

Architecture:
- session is static object.
- Full documentation
- Full regression with tox, covarage etc.

Longer term:
- Refine set_attributes for port etc - IxeObjectWithWrite?
- Use statList command?
- Local Tcl
- Full support for Linux server (including error detection)
- Better error messages
	- Test if Tcl server and chassis on the same version
	- add proper exception regarding miss match on multi server\chassis version
- Implicit load configuration
- Get/Set Enums
- Full support for Linux clients (over sockets only)
- Improve stream stats - performance, set implicitly
- Load cfg
